In this presentation video, Jake Porway talks about how the New York Times R&D Lab uses MongoDB to explore how people are sharing news in the twitter-verse. Of course, they use MongoDB, and for much the same reason that I use it. With MongoDB, you can just throw data into a database, and ‘ad hoc it.’ (I love that hipster science phrase)

''Real'' science works in exactly the same way as this NYT project. To answer a question, we don''t know exactly what data we need, or exactly how that data should be represented. But with MongoDB you can gather that data, throw it into a database with the most convenient structure, and start working on it.
