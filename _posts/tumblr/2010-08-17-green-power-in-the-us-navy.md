Todd Woody of the NYT reports on the US Navy’s dramatic move towards alternative (and renewable) energy sources. When an organization that uses 1% of the United States’s energy commits to sourcing half its energy from green technology by 2020, we have a sure indication that these technologies are maturing.

Two days after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in April, a Navy pilot flew an F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet powered by a biofuel blend made from the seeds of camelina sativa, an inedible plant.
“The plane flew at Mach 1.2, almost 1,000 miles an hour,” said Mr. Mabus, a former governor of Mississippi who has been charged with overseeing the gulf’s restoration from the oil spill. “We named it the Green Hornet. The Green Hornet shows the ability to fly using biofuels and we’re beginning to test this summer on the surface fleet.”
