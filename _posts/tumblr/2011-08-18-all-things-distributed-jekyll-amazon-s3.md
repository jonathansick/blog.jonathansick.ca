Werner Vogels puts his money where his servers are and hosts his blog entirely on S3, sans any server-side content management. How? Jekyll.

He also mentions Cactus, a Python static blog generator, powered by Django templating.

I wonder how much Django one needs to make Cactus work; or conversely, how much Ruby one needs to make Jekyll work. Another project for my infinite free time.
