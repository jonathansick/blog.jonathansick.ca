title: Further thoughts on 'Smart Phone' astronomy apps

I was critical of the GalMass smart phone app because it appears to be a glorified calculator for performing a calculation that needs to be deeply considered. Indeed, Stewart’s paper emphasizes the uncertainties of estimating galaxy masses.

Where ‘smart phone’ applications can be useful is for exploring the behaviours of models. Essentially, dynamically generating figures; something that the Journal publishing paradigm doesn’t let us do easily. Now, I don’t have an Android phone—so I can’t see Stewart’s app beyond the one input screen figure shown in the paper—but this may well be the intent of Stewart’s app. Rather than generating numbers; perhaps what matters is the visualizations (which again, I can’t see).

But this brings up another bone of contention.

If our goal is to generate dynamic/interactive visualizations of models, don’t make it a native app that half the world doesn’t have the hardware to view. Don’t put your app on the Android store; don’t put it on the Apple App Store. Put it on the web. HTML5 and Javascript (even a Python/Matplotlib server side stack) can do everything you need. The point is that these visualizations need to be put in the public domain.
