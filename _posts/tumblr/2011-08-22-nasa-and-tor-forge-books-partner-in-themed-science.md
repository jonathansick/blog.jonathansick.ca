NASA And Tor-Forge Books Partner In Themed Science Fiction WorksIn the tradition of writers-in-residence, Goddard Space Flight Center and Tor are pairing scientists and engineers with science fiction writers. Seems like a great idea, one that might capture and popularize the joy and excitement of a life in space exploration. The hope is that this will attract young sci-fi readers to a life at NASA.

My cynical take, though, is that if every great and inspiring NASA program is cancelled, nothing could help the agency build an all-star engineering workforce. Talent goes to the most promising bidder.
