IT job security is often dependent on making things hard, slow, and complex. If the Exchange Server didn’t require two people to babysit it at all times, that would mean two friends out of work. Of course using hosted Gmail is a bad idea! It’s the same forces and mechanics that slowly turned unions from a force of progress (proper working conditions for all!) to a force of stagnation (only Jack can move the conference chairs, Joe is the only guy who can fix the microphone).

I can sympathize with that sentiment. Did you know that we pay two people to manage the IT needs of the Queen’s Physics department? Amazing. The mail server goes down because we don’t want to host on Gmail; the printer is always broken because we’re not allowed to replace it; people can’t install their own software because they can’t sudo in their own accounts.
