A Meditation on the DeskWriting a thesis is in some ways like writing a memoir. Here are the last two years of my life. In those two years I have thought, read, coded, and written at my desks: either the small-yet-focused desk at Stirling, or the oversized one in my apartment. Although I’ve lately embraced reading (and some writing) on my iPad, I always have, and will, work best at my desk. Like the cyber decks of Neuromancer, there’s something special about being able to plug into the computer. Afterall, my work is entirely virtual. Once the photon is recorded by the camera, all the work I do exists in the abstract space of code and storage.

That’s why this short documentary is amazing. It recognizes the role of the desk in our creative lives, and how we make the desk work for us to become a physical manifestation of our enterprise.
