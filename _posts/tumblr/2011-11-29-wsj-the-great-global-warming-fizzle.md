One of the most offensive pieces to come out of mainstream media commentary of late:


> As with religion, it is presided over by a caste of spectacularly unattractive people pretending to an obscure form of knowledge that promises to make the seas retreat and the winds abate. As with religion, it comes with an elaborate list of virtues, vices and indulgences. As with religion, its claims are often non-falsifiable, hence the convenience of the term “climate change” when thermometers don’t oblige the expected trend lines. As with religion, it is harsh toward skeptics, heretics and other “deniers.” And as with religion, it is susceptible to the earthly temptations of money, power, politics, arrogance and deceit.

In other words, Mr Stephens likens climate science to a religion. Despite being educated at the University of Chicago, I’m assuming that Mr Stephens has never actually taken a science course in higher education.

But Mr Stephens is educated in economics.

So let me propose this: rather than try to deny climate science, perhaps stick to economics. Figure out, using economics, whether the utility of pollution exceeds costs to our health and future. Don’t forget the economic growth opportunities of inventing efficient green technologies. If you can do all that, then I might read you column. Until then Mr Stephens, write about something your own size.

Postscript: Also, ‘spectacularly unattractive people?’ Speak for yourself twerp. Scientists are undeniably hot.
