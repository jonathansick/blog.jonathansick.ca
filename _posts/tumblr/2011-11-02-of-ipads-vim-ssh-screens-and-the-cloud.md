Of iPads, vim, ssh, screen, and the cloudMark O’Connor writes code on his iPad. Vim is the secret sauce, running through iSSH and a screen session on a remote server (known as the cloud, these days). It’s an appealing vision of simplicity, and brings to mind the possibility of going to conferences with only an iPad in the bag.1

Coincidentally, rumours are flying about the web of the Mac Pro’s coming demise. Although I think there are people at Apple who are convinced that Mac Pros are unnecessary—most people just need computers for email, and iPhones are great for that, right?—I’m still comforted by my big aluminium buddy: Marvin the Mac Pro.2 There’s nothing like plugging into a workstation with a massive, multi-tasking, display. I see iPhones, iPads and the cloud as complements to my work. But when I do science, I’m most likely doing it with the Mac Pro. I don’t foresee that changing for quite some time.

Update: See also Rui Carmo’s iPad setup. He’s using tmux instead of screen.



Assuming the availability of wi-fi or 3G, alas. ↩



I’m not the only one who loves Mac Pros. It would be foolish for Apple to gut the segment of its user base that truly thinks different. ↩
