  The Stars like dust encirle me
  And bathe me with their light,
  As though all space and time I see,
  In one great burst of sight.

The Stars like dust encirle me
And bathe me with their light,
As though all space and time I see,
In one great burst of sight.—Isaac Asimov in “The Stars, Like Dust”
