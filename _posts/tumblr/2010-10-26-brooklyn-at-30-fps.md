Brooklyn at 30 fpsMotion landscape photography is an intriguing idea that Cameron Moll puts to great effect in this video. And he nicely pairs the visuals with some Explosions in the Sky. Short but sweet. (Click on the title for a full-size version)



Brooklyn from Cameron Moll on Vimeo.

Just a few of the shots I took during my first trip to Brooklyn. Music is “So Long, Lonesome” by Explosions in the Sky. 
Camera setup: Canon 7D, Zacuto Z-Finder 3x, Canon 17-55mm f/2.8, RODE VideoMic with dead cat, Matthews M25 tripod. (The shot where I’m filming the 7D was done with a Canon HG10 camcorder.)
