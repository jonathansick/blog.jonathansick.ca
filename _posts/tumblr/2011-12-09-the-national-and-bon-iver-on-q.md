The National and Bon Iver on QJian Ghomeshi had great interviews with The National and Bon Iver the other day. The National even workshopped some new songs for the first time.

I hadn’t listened to Q in forever, but lately I’ve been catching up on Q and CBC Radio 3 postcasts with Instacast. In fact, looking at the Q podcast back catalog, I’ve been missing out on a lot.
