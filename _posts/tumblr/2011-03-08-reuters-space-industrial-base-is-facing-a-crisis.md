Reuters: Space industrial base is facing a crisis
  The U.S. space industrial base is facing a crisis unless NASA soon unveils a plan for developing new spacecraft after its final space shuttle mission in June — Reuters


In some ways ways, the erosion of the US space industry and braintrust is already happening. In the 1950s, NASA was able to from start scratch in designing and building, in less than a decade, the Saturn V rockets that would power us to the Moon. Now, with NASA having ridden the Space Shuttle for the past three decades, we are losing the engineering know-how, and industrial capability, to build on that prowess. Rocketry is a use-it-or-lose-it business. Witness, for example, the appalling failure of NASA to produce a working Ares V rocket for the now-defunct Constellation program.

The Obama Administration apparently hopes that private enterprise will replace the contracts that NASA is no longer able to issue. Apparently that hasn’t happened yet. Hopefully that policy kicks-in before the rocket-makers close up their last factory.
