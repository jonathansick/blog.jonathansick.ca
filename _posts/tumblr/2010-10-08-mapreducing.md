As I sit here, churning my pipeline, I realize that I’m becoming a database programmer. We of think of databases as the domain of large surveys, but it turns out that a modest survey, ostensibly manned by a single graduate worker, can produce a lot of data that needs to be managed, queried and accessed. Needless to say, my databases based upon Python pickles, clever as they are, are being stretched. Soon—after the thesis submission apocalypse—I shall muse about MongoDB and CouchDB serving as a backbone for the data-laden observational astronomer. But in the mean time, a couple of interesting pieces on MapReduce have recently appeared on the internet.

Map Reduce: A really simple introduction by Kaushik Sathupadi—map reduce as an org-chart.
Google’s MapReduce in 98 Lines of Python by John Arley Burns.
Update: Stephanie tells me that Google’s instant search isn’t based upon MapReduce. As always, computer scientists are one step ahead of the practitioner.
