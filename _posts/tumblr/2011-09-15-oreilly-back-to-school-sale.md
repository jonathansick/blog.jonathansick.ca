O’Reilly is having a back to school sale! Use code ‘B2SDEAL’ to get 50% off their entire catalog of ebooks and videos. Good ‘til September 28th.

I’ve already bought too many of their ebooks than I care to admit, but here are some upcoming books (due this month) that I’m looking forward to grabbing:

- Designing Data Visualizations
- MongoDB and Python
- GPUs in the Cloud
