Mac OS X 10.7 Lion’s background photo has puzzled me for a while. I’m convinced that its an artist’s rendering, rather than a photo. Most conspicuous is the absence of NGC 205: an elliptical galaxy that ought to be near the bottom of the image in this orientation. Perhaps this is for the best; NGC 205 would distract from the Dock and ruin Steve Jobs’ zen operating system.

Here’s the amateur wide-angle photo by Robert Gendler that I think they based their rendering on.

Hopefully people won’t be too tired of Andromeda by the time our ANDROIDS MegaCam & WIRCam mosaic of M31 is released.
