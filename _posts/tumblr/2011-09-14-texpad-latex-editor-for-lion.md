I just noticed Texpad, a LaTeX editor for Lion (admittedly I was baited into thinking it was a new iPad LaTex editor).

At $14 I probably won’t pick it up, but it does have a nice interface that outlines your document in the sidebar. Better yet, the outline can span across files in a large LaTeX project (a thesis, say).

Otherwise, I would recommend sticking with open source tools like TeXShop, or Vim etc. Personally, I’ve stuck with TextMate+Skim after being frustrated with Vim’s handling of reflow-able prose.
