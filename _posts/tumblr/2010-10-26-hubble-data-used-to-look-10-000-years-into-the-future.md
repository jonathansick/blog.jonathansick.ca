title: Hubble Data Used to Look 10,000 Years into the Future

Astronomers love to say that our telescopes are time machines: we regularly look at the universe as it was thousands, millions, and billions of years ago. It was a surprise then when I got a press release from STScI that the Hubble is being used to look 10,000 years into the future.

What’s actually happening here is that we can predict how a globular cluster, Omega Cen, will look in the future. By looking at the motion of cluster stars across pictures taken a few years apart, Jay Anderson and Roeland van der Marel at STScI were able extrapolate the dynamics of individual stars in the cluster. Amazing stuff.

For the past century the astronomy community has been stockpiling photographic plates, hoping that a time baseline of a century would let us detect motions of stars. It turns out that Hubble has such incredible resolution that we only need a few years for reasonably distant stars to move across the sky enough to be measured.

If you go see Hubble 3D in the IMAX, you’ll see a 3D representation of Omega Cen. That 3D reproduction is based upon the orbital dynamics measured by Jay and Roeland.

Also, I should mention that Jay Anderson was formerly a researcher at Rice University when I was there, and a fellow at Hanzen College. Go Owls!
