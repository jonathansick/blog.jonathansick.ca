A week ago I defended my master’s thesis: The Near-Infrared Imaging of the Andromeda Galaxy. The Andromeda Galaxy, M31, is our closest neighbouring spiral galaxy, making it a wonderful laboratory to learn about how galaxies form, and about the populations of stars that live within them. In my thesis, I presented the first rigorously-calibrated image of that galaxy in the near-infrared wavelengths (light that is just slightly redder than the eye can see).

The near-infrared wavelengths (say, 1–3µm) turn out to be very useful to us astronomers. Infrared light can pierce through dust, so we can interpret the brightness and colour of the light unambiguously. Low-mass stars, which actually dominate the cumulative mass of a galaxy, also emit much of their light in the near-infrared. This makes near-infrared light an excellent tracer of the structure of a galaxy.

Until now, a proper map of the Andromeda Galaxy in the near-infrared had not been constructed because the night sky glows so brightly that the infrared sky can be a thousand times brighter than the galaxy. This fact required a rigorous observational program, backed with a data reduction pipeline to minimize uncertainties in the sky background subtraction. The exact details of this process are informally embargoed until I can publish the paper in early 2011. Stay tuned!
