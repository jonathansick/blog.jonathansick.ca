This NYT article is interesting for two reasons: first, it alludes to the type of urban visualization and data mining that I’m reading about in Beautiful Data and Beautiful Visualization; second, it mentions the hazards of left turning vehicles to pedestrians.
In Kingston, drivers treat Ontario Street to King Street as a seamless route, and turn left as if they were going straight. Its not uncommon for a car to try to turn left across me as I’m in the cross walk. The advice to cross on the right side of the street may be useful to carry out; although it would double my street crossings on the commute to campus.

Dozens of parking spaces will be removed next year from a major Manhattan avenue — officials would not say which one — in an experiment intended to make it easier for drivers turning left and pedestrians crossing at an intersection to see each other.

It would be great if Kingston took this advice too. Along Johnson street it could be nearly impossible to see cars from the sidewalk—and it’s even worse trying to cross in a car. Street parking on major streets is a terrible idea.
