A Costly Quest for the Dark Heart of the CosmosMeanwhile, Dennis Overbye gives us a peek into the politics of science. Already in graduate school I’m learning that it takes a special kind of academic to pull off a large project, and Dr. Ting, with his $1.5B Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, is no exception. I like this passage:


  Behind in the construction schedule, Dr. Ting announced one day that he was canceling the Christmas break. “Perhaps on Christmas Day we will take a few minutes to reflect,” Peter Fisher, an M.I.T. physicist who was there, recalled Dr. Ting saying.
  
  The work got done on time.


Reminds me of one CalTech prof’s letter to an unfortunate post-doc.
