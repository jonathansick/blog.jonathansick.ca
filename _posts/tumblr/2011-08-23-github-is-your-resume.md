Daniel Greenfield makes the case for ditching your resumé and using your social code portfolio for landing a job. This makes a great deal of sense (no doubt a lot of savvy software employers, like Google, already make this an integral part of their hiring procedure).

I hope that astronomy can move towards this approach. For those of us who write software to do astronomy, nothing gives a more complete picture of how we work than our code and version control histories. Reference letters can be exaggerated—even papers can give a false sense of how careful an astronomer is. But in code we see truth.
