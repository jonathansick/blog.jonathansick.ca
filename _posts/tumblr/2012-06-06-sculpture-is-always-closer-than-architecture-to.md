> Sculpture is always closer than architecture to pure form, being mostly liberated from all the obvious constraints (environmental, economic, technological and political) that shape any building’s design. Architecture is a contaminated art in this sense, but that is also a virtue. It’s a social art. It creates social spaces. The best architecture embraces and pushes beyond this, formally.

> There’s a metaphor at play. A free society consensually accepts its governing burdens and principles. Constraint and freedom: the essence of good architecture and a healthy culture.

&mdash; Michael Kimmelman in *A Canopy as Social Cathedral*
