Khoi Vinh, on the gridLovely interview (moving picture) with Khoi Vinh. He’s one of my favorite web design intellectuals, responsible for one of my favorite websites.1 Here he speaks about the grid, this intoxicating design tool that magically structures information on the page.

The poster that I’m presenting next week? Yeah, it’s on a grid.
