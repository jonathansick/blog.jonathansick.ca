Lovely interview (moving picture) with Khoi Vinh. He’s one of my favorite web design intellectuals, responsible for one of my favorite websites.[^1] Here he speaks about the grid, this intoxicating design tool that magically structures information on the page.

The poster that I’m presenting next week? Yeah, it’s on a grid.
