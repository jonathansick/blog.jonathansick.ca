While a number of astronomy applications exist in these markets, they are typically intended for a public audience. There are very few applications that are developed from within the scientific community for productive use in the scientific community (examples of such scientific applications developed by professional astronomers include GravLensHD, CosmoCalc, and Exoplanet).

I’m all for developing innovative technologies for astronomy, but may I count myself as skeptical of this initiative. This may be the post-PC era, but it doesn’t mean that we all have to do everything on our phones—including estimating galaxy masses.

I believe that mobile computing is wonderful where mobile computing makes sense. This means developing better applications for reading papers, managing bibliographies, writing papers and communicating ideas. Or it could mean assisting astronomers in doing on-the-fly computations at the observatory (like iObserve). Or it could mean making smart educational demonstrations. I just don’t see myself needing to do on-the-fly estimations of galaxy masses with an interface that evokes memories of 1995-era Java applets.
