Our Canadian Broadcasting Corporation recently published a meta-news article on the role of anonymous comments in its online news. To me, the debate is whether professional news web sites should continue to treat the news report of a trained journalist with as much importance as the knee-jerk editorial of anonymous commentators by placing both on the same web page. I’ll take a position counter to my role as a Web 2.0 blogger and state my bewilderment that this practice was ever allowed.

The emergence of comments in online news probably arose from the media’s belief that, to stay relevant, they needed to embrace the Web 2.0 foundation of open collaboration witnessed on Wikipedia and blogs. Its hard to watch CNN without a journalist asking a person on the street for their impromptu analysis of Obama’s economic recovery. This isn’t news—it isn’t even a statistically valid survey.

What the news media doesn’t realize is that to build useful discussions in comments, strong curation is required. Wikipedia’s quality didn’t happen by accident, its quality is nearly assured by strong oversight from a core group of editors. One of my favourite community based websites is Macintouch. You can ask questions and submit answers, but notice that you must email all communications to the editors. No instant, anonymous, web forms. Each communication was reviewed by a human before subjecting other humans to it.

At cbcnews.ca, on the other hand, comments are instantly live, without review. Most of the time the authors of the comments fail to remember that they’re publishing words to a world-wide audience; is good grammar and spelling too much to ask for? In many cases, the comments are far removed from the actual thread of the news article. In the end, spending more than a couple minutes on cbcnews.ca leaves me reeling from the apparent idiocy of my fellow Canadians. To compensate for the lack of curation, the CBC editors introduced a lame technological fix of allowing people to comment on whether they agree or disagree with the comment. How meta. It almost makes you forget we were trying to read a news article in the first place.

If the CBC wants to allow their website to continue to be an editorial platform for anonymous commenters, it must at least curate. There are two imaginable excuses that prevent this: 1) there are no resources to review the comments (no, this doesn’t mean crowd-sourced agree/disagree surveys), and 2) they might believe that selectively publishing comments is a form of censorship and violation of free speech.

The solution is simple: don’t publish comments—it’s ok, I’ll still read your news.

Two of my favourite blogs, Daring Fireball, and shawnblanc.net, don’t publish comments. John Gruber neatly summed this policy up by saying:


> You write on your site; I write on mine. That’s a response. […]
  
> What makes DF an efficient and effective soapbox is exactly that it is not noisy.
> My goal is for not a single wasted word to appear anywhere on any page of the site.

This is the web, if you have something to say then you should get a website and write. There is no need to centralize discussion on a single website.  You still see interesting discussions arising from Daring Fireball articles: each party writes a well thought out piece, and the conversing parties hyperlink their articles together. And by requiring each party to post to their own blog you get, in the least, spell checking, and quite often, better quality of thought. When people write under their own names, they often communicate intelligently.

In the realm of traditional news web sites, I believe The New York Times has struck an ideal model. On most pages you aren’t able to comment. This is news, and the NYT believes that the facts stand for themselves. In some cases, where there is an obvious ideological debate that the common citizen might be expected to have useful input towards, the NYT does allow comments. But crucially, these comments are published a link removed from the news article itself. This emphasizes the distinction between news and editorial.

I do hope that cbcnews.ca re-thinks its comment policy. In the meantime, I get the bulk of my news from the New York Times (neglecting Canadian content). Perhaps it would be worth writing a CSS override for cbcnews.ca to omit comments. Problem solved.
