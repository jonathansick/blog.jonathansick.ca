title: NASA ADS searches with Alfred

The market for Mac app launchers/searchers/productivity boosters is surprisingly large. There’s Quicksilver, Launchbar, Bulter, and lately, Alfred.

Somehow I’ve gotten through much of life with Spotlight for launching apps and opening frequently-used files. But in the past couple days I’ve given Alfred a ring. And he’s pretty good. I splurged on the powerpack, which lets me browse iTunes as if I were cd’ing on the command line, among other things.

Even without the Powerpack, some insanely great features of Alfred are his custom searches. There are many built-in. Say you want to integrate x^2 with Wolfram Alpha: tell Alfred “wolfram int x^2”, and it’ll take you to the Alpha site with your answer.

And you can make your own web searches. Here’s one for the astronomers: a basic search of NASA ADS by typing, e.g. “ads Hogg data anlysis recipes”. Here is the custom search recipe (it will auto-install in your Alfred). Alas, Alfred only lets you use one search field, so I have to make do with the ADS basic search. This can be slow compared to the usual author-year searches most of us seem to do on the advanced search page—but it sure is convenient.

Here’s another for making stock charts on finviz.com.
