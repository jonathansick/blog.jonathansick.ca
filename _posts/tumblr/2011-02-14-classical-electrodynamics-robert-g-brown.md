Dr. Brown, at Duke University, has put up a lovely set of notes for his graduate electrodynamics class. It follows Jackson rather closelyâ€”far as I can tell from the relativistic electrodynamics discussion. But it makes for a nice, more conversational, presentation compared to the pithy brutality of Jackson. I kid. Perhaps? The notes are also available as a PDF.
