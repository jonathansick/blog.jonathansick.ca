One of the pleasant suggestions to come from the decadal review was a space borne wide-field near-infrared (1–3.6µm) all-sky survey. The last near-infrared survey was 2MASS, and wide-but-pointed observations are now being done with CFHT/WIRCam and UKIRT/WFCAM. Although this proposed telescope will give a modest resolution improvement over the Mauna Kea sky, the real win will be the obviation of atmospheric sky subtraction. My thesis will soon show just how painful the near-infrared sky is for wide-field studies of low-surface brightness objects. Stern et. al. project that NISS, their proposed telescope, will reach surface brightnesses of µ=25.6 AB magnitudes.

If this project is funded, we could see data flowing by 2016. I’d say this is a good use of $500 million (+ a rocket).
