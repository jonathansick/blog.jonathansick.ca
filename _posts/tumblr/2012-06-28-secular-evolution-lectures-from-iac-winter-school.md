Secular Evolution Lectures from IAC Winter SchoolThe IAC has posted videos from the Secular Evolution Winter school on their new IACTalks website. It was a really fantastic school, and this curriculum could easily constitute the basis for graduate reading courses on galactic and extragalactic astronomy. The rock star lecturers include Kormendy, Binney, Scoville, Calzetti, Peletier, Buta, van Gorkom, and Bosma.1 I enjoyed attending the school in Tenerife last year, and I think I’ll be referring to these lectures again.



For some reason, Athannasoula’s talks aren’t included. A shame; her talks on the dynamics of bar systems were some of the best lectures in the school. ↩
