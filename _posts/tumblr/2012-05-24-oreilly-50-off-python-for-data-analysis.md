title: 'O''Reilly: 50% off ''Python for Data Analysis'''

Today, O’Reilly is offering an early release of Wes McKinney’s upcoming book Python for Data Analysis. Although the book starts at an introductory level, it quickly ramps up with case studies covering some interesting modules that I haven’t started using in my day-to-day research. In particular, McKinney is the author of pandas, an interesting tool for structured data.

Here is the table of contents (note that the book is still largely incomplete; the expected publication data is October 2012):

- Preliminaries
- Whetting your appetite—1.usa.gov and bit.ly examples
- Python Language Essentials
- IPython
- NumPy Basics: Arrays and Vectorized Computation
- Overview and First Steps with pandas
- Data loading and storage [Ed. with pandas, I presume?]
- Data Wrangling and Text Processing
- Reshaping, aggregation, and transformation
- Data Aggregation and Group Operations
- Plotting and Visualization
- Time Series
- Application: Financial Data
- Case Study: US Baby Names 1880-2010
- Advanced NumPy
- SciPy, statsmodels and scikit-learn
- Parallel and Distributed Computing
