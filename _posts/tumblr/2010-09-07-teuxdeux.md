TeuxDeuxRecently I wrote about how I’ve been using OmniFocus on the iPad and Mac to manage research tasks, capture ideas, and review progress. I was asked about task management alternatives outside the Apple ecosystem, and TeuxDeux looks promising.

TeuxDeux looks to have a clean, simple, web interface. It doesn’t have all the fancy Projects, Perspectives and Contexts that OmniFocus allows, but sometimes a simpler interface is all you need. And honestly, I’d use it just for the League Gothic.

Be sure to check out TeuxDeux’s brilliant demo video on Vimeo.
