Paul Krugman’s latest op-ed touches on something that irked me about the US elections this month.


> […] Stan Collender predicted it all. Back in August, he warned Mr. Bernanke that “with Republican policy makers seeing economic hardship as the path to election glory,” they would be “opposed to any actions taken by the Federal Reserve that would make the economy better.” In short, their real fear is not that Fed actions will be harmful, it is that they might succeed.


This is politicking at its worst: putting one’s party ahead of one’s country. It’s disturbing to read that many Republicans campaigned on the premise of No: say no to any initiative put forth by a Democrat, regardless of its content. A Republican would vote against a Democrat’s tax cut, I’m sure. Indeed, Republicans want to repeal health care laws that will save money for America.

To be fair, the same behaviour befalls Canadian politics, and I’m sure the Democrats have stooped to this level before.

But to build ‘electoral glory’ by siding with China and Germany in the hopes of a prolonged recession?
