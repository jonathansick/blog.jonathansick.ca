A new album from Sufjan Stevens is like ambrosia itself. And so soon after his All Delighted People EP, it is doubly so. While I fell in love with the delicate banjo and vocal arrangements from Illinois, Greetings from Michigan and Seven Swans, Age of Adz is a whole new beast. I’ve been listening to the (pre-)pre-release tracks Too Much and I Walked for the past couple days, and I’m excited to see how he has developed upon the orchestral experience of the BQE project. Sufjan’s latest may not be his classic sound, but I don’t think Sufjan would be content with the confines of any such categorization. Says Robin Hilton of NPR: “while the mix is unexpected, Stevens retains his gift for crafting songs that are both epic and intimate.”

And now, NPR is streaming Age of Adz in its entirely until October 12th. Meanwhile, my pre-order from Bandcamp just landed.
