title: Field Notes Dry Transfer Edition

I’m a very particular person. I like to write with a fountain pen in black Noodler’s ink (Polar Bear black for good measure). I like plain paper, and in particular, I like small plain Moleskine notebooks. Sure they’re not exactly what Picasso used, but darn, they’re durable.

But I’m also a typography nerd. So when Field Notes offered a set of notebooks without their iconic logo on the front, I couldn’t resist the DIY typography adventure.

The name of the game is 36-point Futura Bold in beautiful Letraset dry transfer. Using a template they provide (see below) and some awesome video instruction, you set the type onto the Field Notes cover by hand. Apparently this is how one would set basic headlines in days-gone-past. Literal type setting, like this, requires care and planning—there’s no undo. Being the control-freak I am, I cheated and first set my type on the computer to check alignment and kerning. Like Field Notes, I went with generous kerning that gives the notebooks an authoritative, industrial feel.



My first batch of notebooks went to my co-workers. I leave it as an exercise to the reader to figure out who got what.



And this edition went to Stephanie to record her adventures in Australia (it was hard telling Wee-Rex he couldn’t fit in my carry-on):



I’ve already field-tested my own book at CHFT, and these little notebooks are growing on me. They’re small enough to fit in a shirt or jeans pocket, and also small enough to dedicate to a single task or topic. Perhaps I’ll become a Field Notes boy by the time this summer is out.
