Debate surrounding the economic and debt crises has inevitably arrived at the question of taxation. While conservatives rail against taxation as discriminating against the rich in favour of the ‘lazy’ and poor, the fact that the rich carry the weight of a country is a fault of their own success. In an impressive article for The Atlantic, Don Peck defines the fundamental economic and cultural structure of America:

> [..] America was composed of two distinct groups: the rich and the rest. And for the purposes of investment decisions, the second group didn’t matter; tracking its spending habits or worrying over its savings rate was a waste of time. All the action in the American economy was at the top: the richest 1 percent of households earned as much each year as the bottom 60 percent put together; they possessed as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent; and with each passing year, a greater share of the nation’s treasure was flowing through their hands and into their pockets. It was this segment of the population, almost exclusively, that held the key to future growth and future returns. The analysts, Ajay Kapur, Niall Macleod, and Narendra Singh, had coined a term for this state of affairs: plutonomy.
  
Meanwhile, for those who believe that the (relatively) poor can be safely jettisoned from a Utopian society built on low tax, individual affluence and self-sufficiency, the Wall Street Journal notes the Swiss canton of Zug as a cautionary tale.
