title: The ability to spend time away from a screen and a computer and experience
  the world at large and do other things related to the work (speaking or travel or
  just collaborating on projects) is necessary for a healthy mind. So that independence,
  to be able to work on other projects outside of the studio allows everyone to be
  able to explore other experiences and not just for work. The things you do outside
  of work — that you’re passionate about — should be equally nurtured.
