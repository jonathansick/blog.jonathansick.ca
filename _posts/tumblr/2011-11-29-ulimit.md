I was running into problems with Swarp today while making some massive mosaics. Specifically, Swarp complained about not being able to open a weight image that clearly existed. The problem was with the limit on the number of file descriptors that a shell can open. The solution is to use

    ulimit -n 100000

or some other large number. But on a Mac, `ulimit` has been oddly neutered. Instead, you must run the limit command first, before running `ulimit`. The above link shows how to do this for the current session, and how to set up a `launcd` command to make the change permanent across reboots.

I hope that helps the next Mac astronomer whoâ€™s running reductions of many files simultaneously.
