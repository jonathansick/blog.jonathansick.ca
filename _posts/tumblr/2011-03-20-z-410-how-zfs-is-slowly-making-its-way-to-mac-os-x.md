title: 'Z-410: How ZFS is slowly making its way to Mac OS X'

While IT admins charged with running Mac OS X-based file servers might be licking their lips in anticipation of Z-410, Brady told Ars that he isn’t really targeting enterprise customers. “HFS+ cannot scale for server applications like ZFS can, but we think the market for Mac OS X server is in serious decline.” He’s spot on—Apple has cancelled its Xserve and Xserve RAID products, and Mac OS X Server will soon be a free optional install for Lion.
  
Instead, Z-410 is better suited to professional or home users that need highly reliable and easily scalable storage. “There’s a huge chasm between using Xsan over Fibre Channel and a USB drive with Time Machine,” Brady told Ars. “That middle piece is what we’re looking at—users that want the convenience of a device like a Drobo, but with more reliability and [easy verifiability].”

This analysis is spot on for us in the astronomy business too. We don’t all have massive RAIDs or storage area networks attached to our Mac Pros. But a lot of us do have a nest of internal and external drives. Being able to cobble these drives into a single, reliable, storage pool will be a killer app for ZFS.

Too bad ZFS may not be native in OS X in the near future, but the Z-410 project may be worth trying.
