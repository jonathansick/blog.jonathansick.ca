Vim, from across the roomThose who know me, know that I’ve been tight with TextMate for quite some time. I’ve dressed it up in a distinctive white-on-translucent gray with orange and blue trim. It does what I want. But this blog post—nay, guidebook—from Steve Losh has me tempted to stray towards MacVim. His post has all the fixings for making a great Vim experience, and he also points to a collection of bundles that may just make it work for the long run. One that caught my eye is Fugitive, which claims to be “the best Git wrapper of all time.” I’ve sent Stephanie out to investigate that.

And Vim has split windows. Honestly, I’ve been wishing TextMate had those since I switched to it from AlphaX.

At the very least, do check out Losh’s post for the excellent typography. The dynamic header in the margin is a nice touch.
