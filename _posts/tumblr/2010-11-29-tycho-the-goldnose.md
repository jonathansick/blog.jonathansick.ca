Tycho the GoldnoseJohn Tierney, at the New York Times, has a great exposé on  Tycho Brahe: the man, the astronomer, the legend.


  The producers’ chief concern, when they pitched the project, would be dealing with the response from a typical studio executive:
  
  “Look, you’ve got some interesting elements to work with here. I love the royal sex and the poison and the duel — could we call him Goldnose? The clairvoyant jester is a nice device. And I totally get the Tycho-Kepler conflict — high-living nobleman versus tormented commoner. But … do they have to be astronomers?”
