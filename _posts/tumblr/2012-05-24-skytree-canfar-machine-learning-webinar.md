title: 'SKYTREE+CANFAR: Machine Learning Webinar'
tags:

CANFAR (Canadian Advanced Network for Astronomical Research) is hosting a webinar that promises to show Canadian astronomers how to leverage cloud resources for big-data machine learning tasks.

I’m rather intrigued to see what SKYTREE, Alexander Gray’s cloud startup, offers. It seems that they want to provide a turn-key machine learning service. What I wonder, though, is how easy it is to turn an astronomy problem into a SKYTREE workflow. What do I gain in comparison to running an Amazon EC2 instance? I’ll wait and see on May 30th and report back.
