title: Visualization of software development

Michael Ogawa, a PhD student at UC Davis, is doing fascinating work on visualizing the ‘storylines of software development.’ See his visualization of Python, for example. The Processing software for assembling these visualizations is available under GPL. I didn’t realize the SVGs could be interactive (though apparently the original Processing sketch has more interactivity when tracing individual developers).

Ogawa has also worked on visualizing bibliographies. I’ve considered scraping NASA/ADS to visualize the astrophysics literature (though honestly, it would be more appropriate to work directly with the ADS curators on a massive mining project like that). Nonetheless, it would be fascinating to track networks of papers: where did ideas originate? Who works with whom? Another post-MSc (and post-PhD) project.
