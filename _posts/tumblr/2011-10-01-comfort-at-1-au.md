Prasanth Nair has kicked-off a wonderful blog with generous essays on Python in astronomy. Today Prasanth posted a new spectral line identification plotting tool, meant to replace IDL’s lineid_plot. Previously Prasanth also covered some of scipy’s statistical capabilities. This blog, along with astropython.org and the astropy module, look to be the beginnings of a strong and boisterous astro-python community.
