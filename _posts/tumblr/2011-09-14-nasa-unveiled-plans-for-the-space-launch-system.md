  NASA unveiled plans for the Space Launch System today. It will carry the Orion crew vehicle to Earth orbit and beyond. Cut from the same fabric as the Apollo Saturn V era, the SLS has a cargo capacity of 130 tons.

  Unfortunately, the engineering design is probably the easiest part of this rocket program. Having it approved and sustained by Congress will be significantly harder.
