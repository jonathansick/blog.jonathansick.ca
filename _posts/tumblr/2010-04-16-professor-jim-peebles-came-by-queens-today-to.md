Professor Jim Peebles came by Queen’s today to talk about “Finding the Big
Bang,”—incidentally the title of his latest book. It was truly an honour to have
a man who has been central to the development of cosmology and cold dark matter
structure formation theory (he has a book about that too) come to the department.  His
talk gave a refreshing look at the historical development of cosmology. Of course,
the truly special thing about his talk was that it was a first-person history. One
of the take-home points was that cosmology, like all science, was not developed
linearly—or even logically. Different people had different pieces of the puzzle.
But once groups looked at each other’s pieces, a remarkable unification of theory
and observation took hold. In view of the seemingly short-sighted conclusions made
in the early days, he said “science is done by people, and that’s how people operate.”
