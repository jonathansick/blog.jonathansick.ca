Silicon Valley as Star TrekChris Lucianu wrote this incredible analogy to summarize the technology industry:


  After Microsoftâ€™s heavy-handed Soviet-cum-Klingon approach, Apple is serving us the elegant, ascetic, Vulcan strategy of encirclement. All the while the Google Ferengi offer to gift us all the nice goodies, provided we sign our souls off. With just the slightest suspicion that Androids may be carrying the Borg seed in their core.
